# Bite Sized Facts

## Created by: Fact Sized Byters (Ezey Duru, Carmen Bechtel, Leah Kerry, Vivian Lau, Subhanga Upadhyay)
Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the ___ track

This aim of this project is to entertain people as they open a million tabs on our web browsers, as we people all do. This is a chrome extension that pulls data from a variety of sources (listed below) and shows it to them anytime they open a new tab. Users can select preferences that select the specific kinds of facts that they enjoy the most!

    **Ezey Duru**: Worked on the designs and the frontend, structuring the UI, picking the right typography/colors, and making sure all the data fits in exactly \
    **Carmen Bechtel**: UI/UX designer extraordinaire, working together with Ezey to do the above stated items as well \
    **Leah Kerry**: Designed and implemented the frontend and the GitHub repository. Implemented the extension frontend piece with dummy data to make sure it worked \
    **Vivian Lau**: backend data wrangling and data collection services. Worked a lot on the backend data shaping and connection to the frontend bits. Also worked on the user preferences logic\
    **Subhanga Upadhyay**: web scraping, data collection, data consistency, and connection to the frontend

## REFLECTION
### What motivated your team to choose this project?
We love learning little facts throughout the day, but the existing "daily fact" calendars and phone widgets offer little to no customization. It's time we change that! We were thinking about a simple yet elegant way to make people's lives better, on the daily. And the bonus point? Users can pick the facts they want to be shown more. Yay micro-learning!

### Potential future work/improvements?
We wanted to weigh each type of fact by the number of facts in that particular category. This is because Alice in Wonderland may have only 30 facts, but for animals, we have around 6000. We want every category to have a fair chance, unless the user explicitly wants certain categories. Maybe adjusting the frequency of the cateogories yourself...?

Another thing we could do, if we wanted to work really hard, would be to conduct an analysis on what types of facts people are drawn to. Some categories we picked were: animals, history, space, Tufts, etc. We can introduce a lot more cateogories

We could add good, high quality images to supplement our facts with

### What is a challenge you encountered while making this?
Packages all conflicted. Versions, operating systems, etc. Learning how to do web scraping. Balancing number of facts between categories. Finding correct sources of facts. Wrestling with APIs, trying to find them in the first place, ensuring data consistency across multiple sources, the choice of designing a backend system - what it would be, would be implement a database or not, etc? THE TIME CONSTRAINT!!!

### What is a fun or interesting experience you had with another hacker?
It was just a complete blast. With the entire team of hackers. The whole time. Cannot pick one moment or experience. Bonding over (all of our) our love for pineapples and oranges was one
