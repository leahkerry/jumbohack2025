        "content": "What do you do if you’re Tufts student who wants to let off a little steam right before December finals when New England’s winter is at its worst? Strip down and streak naked across campus, of course. Sadly, the “Naked Quad Run,” a tradition that reigned since the 1970s was banned in 2011 for student safety reasons. In response, Tufts students that year instated the “Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll” in which they layered up in absurd outfits and walked slowly (and safely) around the quad."

        "content": "'The Daily Cannon' is a beloved student tradition of vandalism. A replica of a U.S.S. Constitution cannon, the Tufts Cannon is painted over on a nightly basis with campus event details and even specific messages such as retirement well wishes and marriage proposals. If more than one group wants to paint the cannon on the same night, the first to get there will camp out to fend off latecomers. The Cannon even has its own instagram account: @Tufts_Cannon."

        "content": "According to local lore, when a relative asked Charles Tufts what he would do with his land, specifically with “that bleak hill over in Medford,” Tufts replied, “I will put a light on it.” To honor this quote, every freshman lights a candle on the President’s Lawn on the first night on campus. The candle lighting ceremony is repeated the night before graduation—some students even save their freshman year candles to re-use 4 years later."

        "content": "Tufts’ mascot, Jumbo the elephant, has a storied history. Prior to joining the circus act of P.T. Barnum, an early Tufts trustee and benefactor, Jumbo was the largest elephant in captivity. His circus act sparked a “Jumbomania” fad in the United States. After his death, his stuffed hide was donated to Tufts and he was adopted by student athletes as the school’s mascot. For 86 years, students would pop pennies into his trunk or pull on his tail for good luck on an exam or sports game. A fire in 1975 destroyed the stuffed elephant so all that remains of him is his tail and his ashes saved in a peanut butter jar. Student athletes have adopted a new tradition of rubbing the jar for good luck and, when a new athletics director is named, there’s a ceremonial “passing of the ashes” to the successor."
