Gravel is commonly combined with the small aquatic life that gets sucked into the mouth of the Axolotl during feeding. However, this is not a bad thing.

This might seem like an obvious one when you look at the animal, but those enormous ears are pretty good at picking up the sounds of insects in the dark."}, {"content": "Learn about the bat-eared fox!\nThey control their body temperature with their ears too. Most hairy mammals have some part of their body that is bald and exposed to the elements. If you\u2019ve ever seen a dog panting, that\u2019s how they use their tongue to conduct their body heat away from themselves to cool down.

While most hermit crabs spend the majority of their time in the water and love to swim, coconut crabs have adapted to life on land in various ways. In their early stages, the larvae are planktonic and float about wherever the ocean takes them, as they age, much like other hermit crabs, they adopt second-hand gastropod shells and migrate to land after a few weeks.

One method used to harvest the quills from a Porcupine involves throwing a blanket over top of one and collecting the quills that were caught in the material. The actual design of the Porcupine quill has been credited with inspiring the creation of a new type of hypodermic needle. The quills contain backwards-facing barbs and when used as a needle the quill not only penetrates the skin, it will also stay in place.

Upon coming into contact with the air, the web hardens, creating a substance that is 5x stronger than steel.

Despite several management measures to preserve sea turtles, their future is still in question, due to a number of natural and human-induced factors."}, {"content": "Learn about the sea turtle!\nFor more information about sea turtles, explore the SEA TURTLE INFOBOOK."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nA snake's skull is flexible in that the individual bones are able to move away from each other. Elastic ligaments connect the bones to each other. The joint between the upper and lower jaw enables the snake to open their jaws as widely as possible. The two halves of the lower jaw are also connected by ligaments, which enable the pieces to move independently of one another. Such adaptations are necessary for feeding on prey that is larger than their head."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nSnake's teeth are not used to chew their food. The prey, whether killed or still alive, is always swallowed whole. Therefore, the skull must be able to withstand an incredible amount of stress considering snakes are able to take in prey that is 2 to 4 times the width of their head."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nSnakes have powerful digestive enzymes that can break down tough materials like feathers, hair, and bone. Some species inject saliva containing venomous enzymes into their prey. The saliva is injected through teeth called fangs. The venom causes tissue damage and begins the digestive process. Sometimes this venom can be quite dangerous in species like cobras, rattlesnakes, kraits, vipers, and sea snakes. There are approximately 300 snake species that are considered extremely dangerous to humans, although toxic elements can be found in the saliva of many species considered nonvenomous."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nAnother feeding tactic used by snakes is constriction. A constrictor loops its body around prey and exerts pressure on its victim from two or more points as the prey exhales. The constricted animal is prevented from inhaling; death comes from suffocation. Many of the largest snakes, such as the anaconda (Eunectes murinus), are constrictors. Anacondas can reach lengths of more than 7.6 m (25 ft.) and consume birds and small mammals including deer and tropical pigs called peccaries. One large specimen was found to have a 1.8 m (6 ft.) caiman (a type of crocodilian) in its stomach."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nLacking external ear openings, hearing in snakes is geared for sensing vibrations. Their eyesight is basically poor, sensitive only to movement. Snakes usually find prey with their advanced sense of smell. Snakes have a specialized organ called the Jacobson's Organ, which consists of two pits lined with a sensory tissue. When snakes flick their tongue, tiny particles of scent are transported to the pits of Jacobson's Organ, which then tells the snake all about its prey."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nPit vipers have facial pits found below and between the eye and nostril on both sides of the head. The pit is highly sensitive to infrared radiation (heat) and serves as a direction finder in locating warm-blooded prey or predators."}, {"content": "Learn about the snakes!\nThe rattlesnake's rattle is a series of hard segments made of keratin. A new segment is added each time a snake sheds. When shaken, the segments vibrate against each other, producing a familiar buzz."}, {"content": "Learn about the solomon island gecko!\nOne of only a few species of skinks that is known to live an arboreal existence, climbing slowly from branch to branch.

More than one female may use the same 'nest'. The eggs are soft-shelled at first with a very sticky surface. They harden soon after they are laid."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nTokays have padded toes with sticking power, which has long been the obsession of scientists. However, knowing what research has found, it's not surprising. Each of its four feet has five toes. Each toe has fine hairs 1/10 mm long, packed at 5,000 hairs per sq mm (3,000,000 per sq inch). Each hair has 400-1,000 branches that end in a spatula-like structure about 1/50,000 inch long. Each hair is strong enough to support an ant's weight. One million hairs can support a small child!"}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nTokay Geckoes are solitary creatures, only encountering the opposite sex during the breeding season. They are territorial and will defend their space against intruders of the same species and of other species, ensuring less competition for food."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nThese geckoes can inflict severe bites if they are sufficiently threatened."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nTheir nose is used for breathing and also for detecting scents. A large number of sensory cells on a membrane in the nostrils and the Jacobson's organ help tokays to hunt. Their tongue is used to carry scent particles to the holes in their palate. These particles are then transported to the Jacobson's organ, which tells their brain about the environment (smell and taste)."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nThey have folds of skin that prevent them from casting a shadow while resting on a tree. By opening up the skin fold completely, it allows them to blend in with the tree bark."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nAnother important feature of the tokay is its ability to cast off its tail in defense and later regenerate a new one. The cast off part will continue to move for several minutes, giving the gecko time to escape. It takes approximately three weeks for these geckoes to completely regenerate a new tail although it is usually never as long as the original tail."}, {"content": "Learn about the tokay gecko!\nIn parts of Southeast Asia, tokays are regarded as bringers of luck, good fortune, and fertility."}, {"content": "Learn about the tomistoma!\nTomistomas belong to the crocodilian order which also includes alligators, crocodiles, caimans and gharials."}, {"content": "Learn about the tomistoma!\nTomistomas have between 76 and 84 teeth."}, {"content": "Learn about the tomistoma!\nThe tomistoma name is derived from the Greek words tomos (meaning \"sharp\") and stoma (meaning \"mouth\")."}, {"content": "Learn about the tomistoma!\nLike all crocodilians, the gender of their hatchlings is determined by temperature.

Each elliptical egg measures around 70x100 mm (3x4 in) and is more than triple the weight of a chicken egg."}, {"content": "Learn about the white-throated monitor!\nMonitors have forked tongues, making them the only reptiles other than snakes to possess this characteristic. Like snakes, this tongue shape allows for better accuracy in locating a prey's scent."}, {"content": "Learn about the white-throated monitor!\nMonitors practice 'open pursuit' hunting instead of stalking and ambushing. They are very fast despite their massive size because of their powerful leg muscles. Monitors swallow their food whole or in large pieces; they are able to dislocate their thyroid bone in order to enlarge their throat."}, {"content": "Learn about the white-throated monitor!\nMales are extremely territorial.
